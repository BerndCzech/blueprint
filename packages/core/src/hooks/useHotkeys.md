Migrating from [HotkeysTarget](#core/components/hotkeys)?

</h4>

`useHotkeys` is a replacement for HotkeysTarget. You are encouraged to use this new API in your function
components, or the HotkeysTarget2 component in your component classes, as they will be come the standard
APIs in Blueprint v4. See the full
[migration guide](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/useHotkeys-migration) on the wiki.

</div>

The `useHotkeys` hook adds hotkey / keyboard shortcut interactions to your application using a custom React hook.
Compared to the deprecated [Hotkeys](#core/components/hotkeys) API, it works with function components and allows
more customization of the hotkeys dialog.
